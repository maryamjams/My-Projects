# PowerBI Data Visualization
I have created the visualization report of a Cookie Company for three years sales, profit, risks, monthly and yearly revenue and
overall business overview through visualiztion of the data found in their sheets. 

Step 1: Gathered data from different sources i.e database, website, and inventory regional files.

Step 2: Cleaned the data using Power Query and Excel

Step 3: Loaded all datasets into Power Query Editor for initial cleaning, where I removed unnecessary columns, 
handled missing data, and standardized formats (e.g., dates and currencies).

Step 4: Applied transformations such as filtering rows, splitting columns, and creating calculated columns for essential metrics (like ‘Total Revenue’ and 
‘Sales Growth’).

Step 5: Used ‘Merge’ and ‘Append’ functions to combine tables, ensuring a seamless link between datasets for a holistic view of sales 
and customer insights.

Step 6: Performed Data Modeling, established relationships between tables to enable accurate, integrated analysis across data sources 
(e.g., linked ‘Customer ID’ across sales and feedback tables).

Step 7: Created visualizations, presented sales data in donut chart, showing sum of units sold by country 

Step 8: Presented Sum of Revenue by Date and Location a beautiful clustered stacked bar chart

Step 9: Created a stacked bar chart to visualize sum of profit by location 

Step 10: Added a table at the top of the dashboard to present an overview of all the data and visualizations we created, 
including country name, date, day, time, sum of profit, units sold, product name, sum of revenue. 

Step 11: Added a slicer on top left corner to select location wise data on each visual we created.

step 12: Then I created a live dynamic Map visual to select location by selecting on map 

Step 13: Added a Slicer on page 1 to select country wise data with a single click 

Step 14: I created a colorful pie chart to show our monthly and yearly revenue by date

Step 15: To visualize the yearly profit by date I created a Line Chart to easily see profit date wise. 

Step 16: Created Mobile-App version and Web-App dashboard  to present data to our client easily on both the platforms.
