# PowerBI Data Visualization
I have created the visualization report of a Cookie Company for three years sales, profit, risks, monthly and yearly revenue and
overall business overview through visualiztion of the data found in their sheets. 

Step 1: Gathered data from different sources i.e database, website, and inventory regional files.

Step 2: Cleaned the data using Power Query and Excel

Step 3: Loaded all datasets into Power Query Editor for initial cleaning, where I removed unnecessary columns, 
handled missing data, and standardized formats (e.g., dates and currencies).

Step 4: Applied transformations such as filtering rows, splitting columns, and creating calculated columns for essential metrics (like ‘Total Revenue’ and ‘Sales Growth’).
